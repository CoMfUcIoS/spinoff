# spinoff ‚ö°üîÑ

![ci](https://github.com/comfucios/spinoff/workflows/publish/badge.svg)

## Introduction

Serverless functions built with [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) to spin new servers on Hetzner Cloud and shut them down automatically when they are unutilized.

## Use-cases

- Scaling nodes horizontally for video-encoding based on incoming HTTP requests.

## Benefits

- Saving costs for large and expensive servers in Hetzner Cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- [faas-cli](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli)
- opentofu
- id_terraform_rsa.pub file (`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"` save it under ~/.ssh/id_terraform_rsa)

## Provision infrastructure

As of today, the cheapest server type on Hetzner Cloud is `cx22` (1vCPU, 2GB RAM for ‚Ç¨4.08/month or ‚Ç¨0.006/h). Learn more about the wide range of server types [here](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud).

Let's provision a `cx22` server with `faasd` installed. We'll be using [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to initialize the server with `faasd`, as per the [cloud-config.tpl](cloud-config.tpl) file.

## Overview

To make it easier to provide all prerequisites like the OpenFaaS and opentofu command line utilities, we provide a container image and use it for bootstrapping now.

```cli
docker run --rm -it \
  -e TF_VAR_hcloud_token=<HCLOUD_TOKEN> \
  -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  comfucios/spinoff-infra-boostrap
```

- The `-e TF_VAR_hcloud_token=<HCLOUD_TOKEN>` env. var is required to authenticate to Hetzner Cloud and provision the infrastructure.
- The `-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh` parameter is required to configure the Hetzner server with your SSH key (id_terraform_rsa.pub).

Or you could build and run it yourself:

```cli
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/comfucios/spinoff.git
cd spinoff

# Build the bootstrap container
docker build -t spinoff-infra-boostrap .

# Exec into the bootstrap container
docker run --rm -it \
  -e TF_VAR_hcloud_token=<HCLOUD_TOKEN> \
  -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
  spinoff-infra-boostrap
```

## Bootstrap the infrastructure

```cli
# Initialize opentofu
tofu init
# Create the infrastructure in Hetzner Cloud
tofu apply -auto-approve
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```
gateway_url = http://<faasd-node-ip>:8080
login_cmd = faas-cli login -g http://<faasd-node-ip>:8080 -p <random-password>
password = <random-password>
```

Then, access the OpenFaaS UI at http://$FAASD_NODE_IP:8080/ using the username `admin` and the random password generated previously.

As you can see in the picture above, there are two functions already deployed:

- The [spinoff](spinoff) function serves an endpoint to create a new server to process HTTP requests. It will serve the request by creating a new server of type `cx22` with image `debian-12` located on `nbg1` (Nuremberg) on Hetzner Cloud and will perform a `301 Redirect` to the caller. Replace the `X-Api-Key` value with your own.

```cli
curl -v \
 --header "X-Api-Key: <HCLOUD_TOKEN>" \
 http://$FAASD_NODE_IP:8080/function/spinoff?server_type=cx22&image_name=debian-12&location=nbg1
```

- The [spinoff-controller](spinoff-controller) function is triggered based on the cron expression defined in [stack.yml](stack.yml#L22) and is responsible for deleting any running servers that are not doing any work based on the [provided criteria](stack.yml#L27-L29).

For instance, if we want to delete any servers whose CPU load is below under 50% in the last 5 minutes, set the following values:

```yaml
metric_name: "cpu"
metric_threshold: "50"
last_minutes: 5
```

and deploy the spinoff-controller function again:

```cli
faas-cli login -g http://<faasd-node-ip>:8080 -p <password>
faas-cli deploy -g http://<faasd-node-ip>:8080 -f stack.yml
```

Once deployed, it will be automatically called based on the cron schedule.

## Clean up

```cli
# Destroy the infrastructure in Hetzner Cloud
tofu destroy -auto-approve
exit
```

## Troubleshooting

The server should have initialized with the cloud-init configuration right after it has booted. If needed, you could SSH into the server and check the status of the `faasd` service. It should say `active (running)`.

```cli
ssh root@$FAASD_NODE_IP 'systemctl status faasd'

systemctl status faasd
‚óè faasd.service - faasd
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/faasd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2020-12-28 15:14:15 CET; 12min ago
...
(ommited lines)
...
```

The cloud-init output log file (/var/log/cloud-init-output.log) captures console output so it is easy to debug your scripts following a launch if the instance does not behave the way you intended.

```
ssh root@<faasd-node-ip>
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```
